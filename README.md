# SNN_for_Non-Markovian_FPE
The Python codes are designed to numerically solve non-Markovian Fokker–Planck equations(FPE).
The script p1_num.py is used to compute the corresponding Markovian FPE, while p2_sub_num.py applies the subordination scheme to obtain the solution of the non-Markovian Fokker–Planck equation.

The code is demonstrated using a representative example, for which all essential data and parameters are provided. By modifying the relevant parameters, the framework can be straightforwardly extended to other non-Markovian systems.
